    Several recent studies have shown that chickens are bright animals, able to solve complex problems, demonstrate self-control, and worry about the future. Chickens are smarter than cats or dogs and even do some things that have not yet been seen in mammals other than primates. Dr. Chris Evans, who studies animal behavior and communication at Macquarie University in Australia, says, <blockquote>“As a trick at conferences, I sometimes list these attributes, without mentioning chickens, and people think I’m talking about monkeys.” </blockquote>Dr. John Webster of Bristol University found that chickens are capable of understanding cause and effect and that when chickens learn something new, they pass on that knowledge (i.e., they have what scientists call “culture”).</p><br><p>Only seven weeks after they are born, chickens are crowded onto trucks that transport them to the slaughterhouse. Tens of millions of chickens have their wings and legs broken in the process every year. They are trucked through all weather extremes, sometimes over hundreds of miles, without any food or water. At slaughter, chickens are hung upside-down and have their throats slit, and they are often scalded to death in defeathering tanks.</p><p>(End of Chicken Section)<a href="#top" target="_top">Back To Top</a></p>

   A thick, juicy sirloin steak. Sizzling burgers on the grill. A finely sliced roast beef sandwich topped with barbecue sauce. However you choose to eat it, beef can be absolutely delicious.Not only does beef taste great, but it is also a nutritional powerhouse. It’s packed with protein, B vitamins, iron, and other vitamins and minerals that are essential for optimal human health.</p><br><p>
    If eating beef and other red meat is unhealthy for humans, then why can carnivores survive on a meat-only diet? New research has found that a sugar, called Neu5Gc, found within red meat, also naturally occurs within carnivorous animals but not within humans.<br><blockquote><h3>The result?</h3></blockquote>

    <p>When you eat red meat, your body reacts to Neu5Gc as if it were a harmful bacteria. As your body begins to “fight” this foreign type of sugar, inflammation builds and your immune system weakens, leaving you more susceptible to other threatening bacteria, viruses, and disease.</p>

    <p>For years there has been speculation that eating red meat, such as beef, can lead to cancer, and recently this suspicion has been proven true. When beef is processed for enhanced flavour or increased shelf-life (think back to that roast beef sandwich), it becomes deadly.

<p>In fact, the <h4>World Health Organization (WHO)</h4> puts processed beef in the same cancer-risk category as smoking and exposure to asbestos!</p>

<p>What about unprocessed beef, like steak? Well, this type of beef is only considered, “probably carcinogenic.”</p>

    Wonderfully addictive, cultural, and artistic -- sushi remains a mystery to the uninitiated. Why would anyone want to pay so much for a few tidbits of raw fish? Unlike the supermarket sushi slopped out by chains in the West, a true sushi experience is unforgettable and difficult to recreate. Masters in Japan know how to make each bite a ride of color, texture, taste, and presentation.</p>


<p>If going for a proper experience, know the correct way to eat sushi. Hint: slathering each piece with soy sauce and wasabi isn't the best way!</p>


<p><h3>Sushi Originated Outside of Japan</h3>
Although the Japanese get full credit for what we call sushi today, the inspiration for sushi is thought to have started in Southeast Asia. Nare-zushi, fermented fish wrapped in sour rice, originated somewhere around the Mekong River before spreading into China and later Japan.</p>

<p>The modern-day concept of sushi was invented in Japan by Hanaya Yohei sometime around the end of the Edo period sometime in the mid 1800s.</p>


<p><h3>Sushi Began as Cheap Fast Food</h3></p>
Once upon a time, sushi didn't require a platinum credit card to enjoy. Sushi caught on originally as a cheap, quick snack to eat with the hands while enjoying a theater performance. Forget the popcorn: pass the sushi!</p>

  	Today, as the founder of Isha, an organization devoted to humanitarian causes, he lights the path for millions. The term guru, he notes, means "dispeller of darkness, someone who opens the door for you... As a guru, I have no doctrine to teach, no philosophy to impact, no belief to propagate. And thaat is because the only solution for all the ills that plague humanity is self-transformation.</p></div></div>
